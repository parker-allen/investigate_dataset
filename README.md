# investigate-dataset

In this report, I am going to be looking at different factors of movies and if different variables are correlated to others. I will be looking at vote count and vote average. Basically how many people rated a movie and what the average rating was
 
The dataset that we have is over 10,000 movies, big and small. It includes data like the cast, producing company, budget, release date, popularity, and more. I won't be using all of these columns but they're nice to have.
